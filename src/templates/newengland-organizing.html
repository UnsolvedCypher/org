				<p>If you’re looking to organize a cube competition in New England, you’re in the right place! Please read this <strong>entire</strong> page before getting in touch with, as it’s important that you understand exactly what organizing involves.</p>
				<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-qjvGF3loVR0sr-AaDGZE2C7YgwcC1dP2wdPc3BT8fM/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a>’s a link to the competition organization spreadsheet. It will be discussed later on this page. Please go to this page, go to File &gt; Make a Copy, and rename it to your competition.</p>
				<h2 id="are-you-qualified">Are you qualified?</h2>
				<p>If you’re looking to organize, you should have a very good understanding of how competitions work. This doesn’t mean you need to know everything, but you should have helped out significantly during at least a few competitions. If you have helped out significantly, you’ve probably interacted with a Delegate a bit and they likely at least know who you are. In short, you should have a general idea of what events are popular, how long stuff takes, and what staff are needed to do what.</p>
				<p>Even if you have helped out in the past and have a good idea of how everything works, it is much easier to organize with a friend. We would suggest that you do this for at least your first competition, just because of the time commitment required. We do have some local organizers who we may be able to pair you up with to help you get the hang of some of these steps.</p>
				<h2 id="getting-in-touch">Getting in touch</h2>
				<p>Once you are ready to contact us, please feel free to send us an email to <a href="mailto:newengland@cubingusa.org">newengland@cubingusa.org</a>. This address goes to all local Delegates and some veteran organizers who are happy to help out. We do our best to respond promptly, but if you don’t hear back for a few days, please send a follow-up email to make sure yours didn’t get lost.</p>
				<h2 id="role-of-the-organizer-and-the-delegate">Role of the organizer and the Delegate</h2>
				<p>The organizer and Delegate have several roles, but these can sometimes vary by region throughout the world. Here we want to describe exactly what the Delegate will do, and what the organizer (you) will need to do.</p>
				<h3 id="choosing-the-date">Choosing the date</h3>
				<p>Competitions have to be about 3 weeks apart if they’re within 100km of each other by WCA Regulations. Once you start with the organizing process, the Delegate will share a spreadsheet with you with upcoming competitions so we can ensure your competition doesn’t conflict with other competitions. Of course, the date must also work for the Delegate, organizer(s), and the venue itself. It’s best to choose a date that doesn’t conflict with a major holiday (like winter break) or other dates when students might be busy or away.</p>
				<h3 id="the-venue">The venue</h3>
				<p>The venue is a key part of the competition experience. The organizer is entirely responsible for choosing and booking the venue. Of course, the Delegate needs to approve the venue (do NOT book without explicit Delegate approval). In general, you should look for a venue that has</p>
				<ul>
						<li>enough space for everyone (there is usually extra person per competitor, so the room should be able to easily hold double the competitor limit)</li>
						<li>an internet connection, preferably WiFi</li>
						<li>a reasonable temperature (not too hot or too cold)</li>
						<li>a reasonable price (this will be discussed later)</li>
						<li>a PA system (nice to have, but not a requirement)</li>
						<li>a projector (even less of a requirement but still nice to have)</li>
						<li>tables (rectangular competition tables are a must (or you’ll need to rent some), and other tables for the audience and competitors to sit at are nice)</li>
						<li>lighting that is appropriate for solving that will be relatively consistent throughout the day</li>

				</ul>
				<p>When you start writing up a budget, you should have a good idea of how much the venue will cost. Schools and universities can often provide low-cost venues, but that’s not always an option. Be sure to make note of required custodians or police officers, as this usually costs extra. Places of worship like churches may be good candidates, but their space is often either too small or not suitable (ie full of pews). Community centers and similar places are also good venues to try.</p>
				<h3 id="pa-system-wifi">PA System, WiFi</h3>
				<p>A PA system is really a must. If the venue doesn’t have one, Matthew McMillan has one he may be able to bring, but he needs to know this in advance. It’s very difficult to have a competition where all announcements are made by shouting. Similarly, it’s possible to have a competition without WiFi, but it’s far from ideal. If this has to happen, let your Delegate know in advance.</p>
				<h3 id="the-finances">The finances</h3>
				<p>The organizer is responsible for creating a budget, though the Delegate will need to approve it. The organizer will usually need to create a Stripe account to collect the registration fees and link this to the WCA website, but I’m happy to do this if that poses a problem. Please fill out the budget tab in the spreadsheet linked to at the top of this document when it’s time to make a budget. Note that you should plan for registration income to cover printing costs, battery costs, and any other costs related to the competition while still leaving a safe profit margin. We generally prefer to use final profits from a competition to purchase future equipment for the region.</p>
				<h3 id="deciding-on-events">Deciding on events</h3>
				<p>You definitely have some say over what events you want, but this competition should benefit the region too. Holding at least some beginner events, like 3x3, 2x2, and Pyraminx allows beginners to compete which is good for the community. It’s fine if you want to have less common events like 7x7, but the competition should be fun for everyone. In terms of scheduling, you should create a tentative schedule based on what you think is realistic. It’s good to add buffer time in case some events get behind. The Delegate will help you adjust the schedule to be more reasonable if needed.</p>
				<h3 id="the-schedule">The schedule</h3>
				<p>The organizer is responsible for creating the schedule, and the Delegate will approve it and make suggestions to try to accurately reflect realistic times. Please fill out the scheduling section of the spreadsheet at the top of this document when it’s time to make a schedule. While this will vary greatly depending on the competition, you should almost always have a new competitor tutorial at or around the beginning of the day before any popular events have started. We also suggest having some buffer time at some point in the day in case we get behind schedule. One way to do this is to make lunch longer than it needs to be so that it can also serve as a buffer should the competition fall behind.</p>
				<h3 id="the-website">The website</h3>
				<p>The Delegate will create a WCA website for your competition and send you a link. Be sure you’re signed in to view the site, since it won’t be public yet. You are responsible for filling in all relevant information, and then the Delegate will approve the site and send it to the WCA Competition Announcement Committee when it’s ready to announce. One of the decisions you’ll have to make is when to open and registration. You will generally want to leave a week or two between when the competition is announced and when registration opens to give everyone a chance to learn about the competition and decide whether they want to sign up. You should also leave some time between the closing of registration and the competition itself to give yourself time to generate and print the scorecards.</p>
				<h2 id="after-announcing-the-competition">After announcing the competition</h2>
				<p>There is still work to be done after the competition is announced! During this time it is imperative that you regularly check your email and respond to competitors and the delegate as many things are time sensitive.</p>
				<h3 id="registration-competitor-limits-and-wait-lists">Registration, competitor limits, and wait lists</h3>
				<p>Registration is done on the WCA website. When a competitor pays, they will need to be manually accepted by the organizer or Delegate to actually be registered. Registration should generally open as soon as possible, but it’s good to leave some time after the competition is announced just for people to be able to find out about it before they have to register.</p>
				<p>Competitor limits are a big deal. They are part of the WCA regulations. No competitors can be accepted when the limit is reached, no matter what, so be extra careful when accepting registrations. This means you should take extra care in deciding the competitor limit. You should plan for twice the number of people at the competition as there are competitors (so 200 total people if the cap is 100). Most local competitions have caps of about 90-150. Going below this is fine if that is what the venue can hold and you’re in a location where you expect lower turnout, but we would advise not going too far above this, if at all.</p>
				<p>You can have a waitlist for the competition, but this has to be announced in advance with instructions posted on the website. Typically, we will ask waitlisted individuals to pay, and then refund them if they don’t get in. In these cases, it’s good to offer a full or partial refund to competitors who drop out, to encourage them in letting us know that they can’t make it anymore so we can take someone off the waitlist. There should be a final date at which the waitlist stops moving (typically two weeks before the competition) and refunds stop. Be sure to leave a week or two after registration closes to be able to print out scorecards.</p>
				<h3 id="lunch">Lunch</h3>
				<p>You may choose to provide lunch for the competitors and their families. You should really consider doing this if the competition is in a location where there aren’t very many places to get a quick lunch. Pizza is usually easiest to coordinate, and not too expensive. Keep in mind that you’ll want to talk to the pizza place well in advance to see if they have bulk pricing and to make sure they’re able to handle such a large order.</p>
				<h3 id="cubecomps">CubeComps</h3>
				<p>CubeComps is the live results system currently used just about everywhere. This will need to be set up after the competition is announced. You should email <a href="mailto:admins@cubecomps.com">admins@cubecomps.com</a> after it’s announced to get this set up. There is also some setup work involved in actually importing your registration file, and you’ll need to set up rounds and cutoffs within CubeComps. Your Delegate can help you with this if you have trouble doing this.</p>
				<p>When registration does close, you’ll need to go into the registration manager on the WCA website, and sort competitors by first name. Then, select all paid competitors and click on “Export to CSV”. You’ll need this to import into both Groupifier and CubeComps.</p>
				<p>In CubeComps, after your email <a href="mailto:admins@cubecomps.com">admins@cubecomps.com</a> to create a site for your competition, you can log in as the administrator and upload the csv. You’ll need to set cutoffs for all of the events with cutoffs so that they are processed correctly. You’ll also need to set the number of advancing competitors. Let us know if you need help with this. By the way, if you’ve read this far, also let us know about your favorite animal.</p>
				<h3 id="scorecards-and-certificates">Scorecards and certificates</h3>
				<p>The organizer is responsible for generating and printing scorecards as well as designing and printing the certificates. <a href="https://jonatanklosko.github.io/groupifier/">Groupifier</a> is typically used for scorecard generation of first round cards and CubeComps is used to generate blank cards. Groupifier is pretty good, and divides people into groups based on the number of stations. I’m working on a solution that will do more, but for now, this will do. It also optionally assigns staffing positions. We are happy to help you set this up, but this is only possible after registration closes. You should post groups on the website when they have been generated, and it’s also a good idea to send out an email a few days before the competition to let everyone know about the groups and any other last-minute information they may need, like parking.</p>
				<p>Matthew McMillan designs certificates using GIMP for competitions he organize since he has some graphic design skills. If you’d like him to do this for your competition, please let him know well in advance so he has time to do this. Oh, by the way, when you do get in touch with us, let us know what your favorite flavor of ice cream is. That lets us know you’re actually reading this document. (Yes, we’re serious).</p>
				<h3 id="sponsorship">Sponsorship</h3>
				<p>Many competitions are sponsored by cube stores, who will provide prizes and sometimes even vend at the competition. You should try to figure this out before announcing.</p>
				<h3 id="cubingusa-supported-competitions">CubingUSA Supported Competitions</h3>
				<p>CubingUSA is supporting some competitions. Here’s a brief summary from their website:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<ul>
						<li><em>Organizers must submit an application including an estimated budget at least 60 days in advance.</em></li>

						<li><em>Any net income goes into the CubingUSA general fund.</em></li>

						<li><em>Organizers must agree to the CubingUSA Code of Conduct as seen on the Documents page.</em></li>

						<li><em>Notably, organizers may not personally financially benefit and must report any potential conflicts of interest.</em></li>

						<li><em>Expenses must be pre-approved and may only be reimbursed with receipts.</em></li>

						<li><em>Expenses that were not pre-approved may be rejected at CubingUSA’s discretion.</em></li>

						<li><em>All sponsorships, partnerships, and prizes must be pre-approved.</em></li>

						<li><em>A CubingUSA Deputy, appointed by the CubingUSA Board of Directors, must be involved in the organization of the competition and must be present at the competition to ensure relevant policies are followed. (CubingUSA Deputies may or may not also be an organizer or WCA Delegate.)</em></li>

						<li><em>A Financial Report must be submitted after the competition.</em></li>
					</ul>
				</blockquote>
				<p>– <em><a href="https://cubingusa.org/supported">CubingUSA</a></em></p>
				<p>The main benefit of this is that you can use their nonprofit status (which can result in venue discounts) and that finances are handled in a more official way. If this is something you’re interested in, let us and we can work to make this happen. Note that this doesn’t change what the competition is actually like the day of.</p>
				<h3 id="coordinating-staff">Coordinating Staff</h3>
				<p>We have a template of a Google Form we use to collect staff applications which the Delegate will set up. While we’re happy to provide guidance, the organizer is responsible for providing lunch to the staff and properly coordinating with all staff members.</p>
				<p>Staff typically have perks of free registration and free lunch in exchange for helping out all day. Staff must pay to register and will be refunded after the competition, as an incentive to actually do what is expected of them. Staff applications are posted on the website to allow anyone to fill out a form and apply for staff, but it’s up to our discretion to vet these people and make sure qualified people will be running the competition.</p>
				<p>Additionally, at recent competitions, we have been doing what is known as the “Hungarian System” where all competitors are assigned judging roles. This helps people become familiar with judging, and reduces the need for asking for volunteers constantly. It’s great to have a competitor tutorial at the beginning of the competition to help people understand how judging works, and even how competing works. This significantly reduces incidents during the competition when people are aware of the basics, like +2 penalties</p>
				<h3 id="the-day-of">The day of</h3>
				<p>The Delegate will bring equipment to the competition, but you should budget for battery money as the equipment requires lots of batteries. The Delegate will usually arrive early to help set up, but it’s ideal if the venue could be set up the night before. Note that the organizer is expected to be there well before the start of the competition. The organizer should also be the one making announcements, laying out scorecards, and making sure everything that needs to be happening is happening. The Delegate’s role is to ensure that WCA Regulations are being followed, not to run the event. That being said, your Delegate has done plenty of organizing before and should serve as a resource to the organizer.</p>
