    All events have <strong>qualifying times</strong>, which must be set in other WCA competitions.  You must qualify for at least one event in order to register for the competition.  After registration closes, we will remove competitors from all events in which they are not qualified.  It is your responsibility to ensure that you are qualified before registering.
