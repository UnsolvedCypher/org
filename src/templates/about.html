          CubingUSA is a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to the promotion of speedcubing in the United States.  Speedcubing is the act of solving twisty puzzles, such as the Rubik's Cube&trade;, as quickly as possible.  Since 2003, over 15,000 competitors, mostly teenagers, have participated in over 700 speedcubing competitions in the United States.  Besides solving the well-known Rubik's Cube&trade;, competitors solve other puzzles including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyraminx" target="_blank">Pyraminx</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-1_(puzzle)" target="_blank">Square-1</a>, and other solving variants such as one-handed solving and blindfolded solving.

          Speedcubing provides participants with significant opportunities for educational development, particularly in STEM fields, by encouraging problem solving and analytical thinking.  The skills used in speedcubing are directly applicable to abstract math, and develop a background that is useful for science and engineering.  In addition, we aim to provide leadership and growth opportunities to teenagers in our community.

          Since 2004, we have organized the annual US National Championships in speedcubing.  Each year, we hold Nationals in a different location, in order to make the competition accessible to as many competitors as possible.  In 2017, we held CubingUSA Nationals in Fort Wayne, Indiana.  656 competitors from across the United States attended, and completed over 20,0000 solves during the competition.  We strive to provide a high-quality, fair, professional, and enjoyable competition experience for all competitors.
